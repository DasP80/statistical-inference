# Statistical Inference 

It includes 2 rmarkdown reports covering the following topics:

Part 1: A simulation exercise

Part 2: Basic inferential data analysis

# Part 1: A simulation exercise


# Overview: 

The purpose of this data analysis is to investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. The lambda will be set to 0.2 for all of the simulations. This investigation will compare the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials over 1000 simulations.

It contains code for :

. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.

. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.

. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.


# Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis

# Overview:

The purpose of the this data analysis is to analyse the ToothGrowth data set by comparing the guinea tooth growth by supplement and dose. 

The following are done as part of analysis:

. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses

. Provide a basic summary of the data.

. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. 

. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
